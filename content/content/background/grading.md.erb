title: Cosi 166b Grading
---
#### Scores
There are many expecations, homeworks, assigments and/or quizes, and a several large ones. All of them are individually scored on a scale of 1-100 which you can interpret as follows:

* 90 - 100: Exceeds Expectations (A- -> A+)
* 80 - 90: Meets Expectations (B- -> B+)
* 70 - 80: Needs Improvement (C- -> C+)
* 60 - 70: Unacceptable (D- -> D+)
*      40: Not handed in

#### Deadlines and consequences
* Regular homework is due on the day of class.
* Homeworks are scored on a 1-100 scale
* You can get an extension by talking to the TA, up to a point
* If you hand it in after a granted extension you will loose 15 points on it
* If you don't hand regular homework in at all then you get 40 points for it, which will significantly affect the average!
* Participation-only work is graded at 100 if you make a good faith effort. It is not graded for correctness. If you do not hand it in by the deadline, then it's graded as a zero.

#### Final Grade
These are calculated as a weighted average of the scores on individual homeworks. The weights are as follows:

* **Class Participation:** 10%
  * Do you show up on time (or let the teachers know ahead of time if you cannot?) Do you ask good questions, and contribute to the discussion? Do you help the class move forward and stay focused? When called on or in discussions do you demonstrate that you have done the assigned reading or work?
  * Do you work within the Portfolio so we can give you just-in-time feedback?
  * Have you responded to the "Participation Only" assignments with a good faith effort?

* **Non Programming assignments:** 20%
  * Are responses thoughtful?
  * Do they introduce new ideas instead of just summarizing the materials?
  * Do they provide insight and connect to material outside of the course?

* **Team Contribution:** 15%
  * Do you contribute personally to your team?
  * Are you a positive influence on productivity?
  * Do your team mates like working with you?
  * Are you at the center of problems or of solutions?
  * This is based on a self- and peer- assessment

* **Team (including Final Project) Deliverables:** 35%
  * Does the product work and do what it supposed to do?
  * Is the architecture reasonable and sound?
  * Does it represent good software engineering practices?
  * Did the project go beyond the basic Rails structures that you learned in class and discover and apply new techniques, tools, technologies?
  * Is the presentation well designed, planned and delivered?
  * Is there a good demo story?
  * Is the portfolio page thoughtful and complete?

* **Programming Assignments**: 20%
  * Does the program work?
  * Does it use language features in a good way?
  * Is it designed with good performance in mind?
  * Does it follow good coding practices?

* **Extra Credit:**
  * Ask me if you want to do an extra credit assignment
  * The latest you can ask me is two weeks before the last day of instruction
  * Note: it's easier to push your grade up by doingn well on the core assignments
  * An excellent job here will bump your grade at most one step (e.g. B+ -> A-)
