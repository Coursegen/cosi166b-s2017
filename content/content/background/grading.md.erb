#### General Rubric

* **Class Participation:** ~10%: Do you show up on time (or let the teachers know ahead of time if you cannot?) Do you ask good questions, and contribute to the discussion? Do you help the class move forward and stay focused? When called on or in discussions do you demonstrate that you have done the assigned reading or work? Do you make a good faith effort at responding to all "Participation Only" work?

* **Programming Assignments**: ~30%:*: Does the program work as required? Does it use language, platform and framework features in a good way? Is it well designed? Does it avoid code smells? Does it follow good coding practices? Has testing been considered? Has performance been considered?

* **Team Assignments (excluding Final Deliverables) **: ~20%: Does the work reflect an understanding of the concepts covered in class? Does it satisfy the requirements of the assigment? Does it show thoughtfulness, careful thought, professionalism?

* **Final Project and Final Deliverables**: ~40%:  Does the product work and do what it supposed to do? Is the architecture reasonable and sound? Does it represent good software engineering practice? Did the project go beyond the basic Rails structures that you learned in class? Does it apply several interesting engineering or architectural techniques above and beyond? Was the presentation well designed, planned and delivered? How did the judges see the product presentation and demo? How well done is the portfolio page?

* **Team Contribution (based on peer and self assessments)** ~10%:  Do you contribute personally to your team? Are you a positive influence on productivity? Are you a reliable team member? Do your team mates like working with you? Are you at the center of problems or of solutions?

#### Extra Credit

  * Ask me if you want to do an extra credit assignment
  * The latest you can ask me is two weeks before the last day of instruction
  * Note: it's easier to push your grade up by doingn well on the core assignments
  * An excellent job here will bump your grade at most one step (e.g. B+ -> A-)
