<%= homework_hdr %>
* All your project work (other than the Portfolio) will be using Git and Github. Git is (as of now) one of the most popular "source code management" utilities. Students that don't really master it will have a hard time throughout the course. It deserves your carefull attention. I have listed several useful links at the end of this assignment: [The Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book) - Read the first two chapters and do all the technical steps on your computer and using an account on Github. Really try and understand this.
* Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. This assignment will get you to write some basic code with Ruby. You will learn how to read files work with data in arrays and hashes. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* Continue with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). Your success in the whole course will be strongly affected by how comfortable you get with Ruby. It's a really fun and interesting language.You should be at least up to Lesson 18 where you will learn about working with files. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>
* Read up on all the  <%= link_to_incubator :prod_candidates %> that are available. Try to undertand and visualize what each one might be about. Remember the caveat: Don't set the bar at "this is the most wonderful product idea I ever saw". Set it at "this is a product that could be interesting to develop and work on."

#### Homework Discussion
* What do you think of git? What is the purpose of Git. Is it like anything else you've used before?
* What progress do you have on Movies so far?
* New product ideas?

#### How "Portfolio" will work
* <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>

#### Lab Objectives

* Practice your Unix command line.
* Create a Github account and experiment
	* ONE subdirectory per project!
	* Git init the subdir
	* Add it as a public repo on Github
* Check your Ruby installation
* Continue with Ruby the hard way
* Continue with <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>.

#### Reference links
* Take a look at our own <%= link_to_topic :git %>. You will find helpful info and several other links.

#### Next Class
