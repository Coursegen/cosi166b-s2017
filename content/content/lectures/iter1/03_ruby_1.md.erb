<%= homework_hdr %>
* **RHW**:  Continue with RHW: [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). You should be at least up to Lesson 40 where you will learn about working with files. I know it's going fast, but we are trying to get up the learning curve quickly. The lessons are getting a lot more difficult, arent they? Don't give up or start slacking, keep at it! Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* **Products**: Look through and think about the <%= link_to_incubator :prod_candidates %> that are available. Pick one or two or three that you might find really interesting to work on. Remember the caveat: Don't set the bar at "this is the most wonderful product idea I ever saw". Set it at "this is a product that could be interesting to develop and work on." In your deliverable, list the names of the projects on the list that you find really interesting. Secondly, describe using the standard format a product of your own that would meet the same criterion. <%= deliverable_popdf("Submit your report to Latte.") %>
* **GIT** Please make sure you have the "git" program installed on your computer. If you type `git --version` you should get a version around 2.5 or more.
* **PA_MOVIES_1**: Complete <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. This assignment will get you to write some basic code with Ruby. You will learn how to read files work with data in arrays and hashes. If you are stuck, ask one of our wonderful TAs for assistance. Up to now you have been coding inside your own <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. <%= deliverable "Your PA1 submission, zipped." %>

#### Homework Review
* Discuss progress on the ruby work.
* Look at some representative code in the portfolio
* Look over results of product review


##### Github open play instructions
* Notes about Git and Github: <%= link_to_topic :git %>

1. Everyone sign up to a free Github account
1. Make sure you know your github username and password
1. Locate the **HTTPS clone URL** (not the SSH url) within here: https://github.com/Cosi-166/my-play-project
1. Everyone clone this repo to your top level portfolio directory: [my-play-project](https://github.com/Cosi-166/my-play-project): `git clone https:\\xxxx`
1. Change to the directory that was created by git clone (`my-play-project`)
1. Run your text editor and create a file and put some text into it
1. Check the status of your repo (`git status`)
1. Add that new file to the staging area for git (`git add`)
1. Now with that one change, create a new git commit (`git commit`)
1. Your local copy of the repo now has one more commit than the server had
1. But notice that all your classmates are doing the same, so, there may already be some more commits on the server. So just to make sure, pull the state down of the repo which is on the server. (`git pull`)
1. Now push your repo (and all its commits) to the server (`git push`)
1. Double check what the state of your local repo is (`git status`)
1. Now locate a file that you didn't create, and make a change to it using your text editor.
1. Follow the same steps above to send that change up to the server
1. Continue to play and play and play*
