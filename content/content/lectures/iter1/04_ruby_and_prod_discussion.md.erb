* **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (\[RORT\])](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning), . Chapter 1 Reviews the installation of Ruby and of Rails, and Chapter 4 Reviews Ruby. It should come very easy given the work you've done so far. Still there is good stuff to learn there, so don't cut corners! <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit by 8am on the day of class." %>
* **PROD:** Meet outside of class for 1 hour with 3 other students, look through and discuss the project options. These are not necessarily going to be your teammates. It's just a forum to immerse yourelf in the project ideas and exchange ideas. Discuss discuss discuss. I know it's hard to find time, but really try to do it so you can really get a feel of where you could take each idea.

#### Notes about your installation

<%= callout("DO NOT", " Don't install RVM. You don't need it and it will make your life difficult.") %>

* Instead install rbenv, which is far simpler and does the same: [Rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). Ask for help if you need it.
* You need a simple text editor. If you don't have one, I recommend [Atom ](http://atom.io)

#### First product selection discussion
* I will ask the groups of 3 to talk about what products they liked. Give your names!
* Sales pitches for products (Pito and any other students)
* How close to the writeup will the product have to be?
* Do we have to use ruby on rails? (yes)
* Write ideas on the board as fast as we can!

<%= callout("Our Goal", " Post about 20 product ideas in the Latte Product Ideas forum during class.") %>

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
