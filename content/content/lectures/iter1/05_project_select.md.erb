* **RTHW:** Finish with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html) up and including Lesson 45. You will learn about the wonders of arrays and hashes. Also one of the more advanced ruby features, modules. And now you start getting into somewhat more abstract stuff, object oriented analysis and design. Remember that your scratch work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. <%= deliverable "Code from RTHW last exercise, zipped" %>
* **Movies2**: Begin working on movies_2. It's a continuation of movies_1. It will be due soon! As usual, you please do your coding in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. Start a new top level directory for this called "movies-2".

#### Homework discussion
* From <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>, discuss the questions to ponder.
* Introduce <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>, explain it, talk about CodeClimate

#### Some ruby to play with
<%= link_to_topic :intro_tut %>

#### Product Ideas and Teams
* Today we will try and form teams. It will be chaotic so try and stay calm :)
* Each team will be 4 or 5 students (this is a change due to the class size)
* We will be doing between 8 and 10 projects
* If needed we describe them again
* We can add new projects still!

#### Team Discussion
* *Important*, let's review: <%= link_to_topic :working_in_teams %>
* If time: Quick intro to <%= link_to_topic :agile_methodology %>
* A significant part of your grade will depend on how well your team functions
* Teams will be 4 or 5 people (rounding as needed). Teams will be assigned by Pito ahead of time.

#### Next Class
* Lets look at what's next: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
