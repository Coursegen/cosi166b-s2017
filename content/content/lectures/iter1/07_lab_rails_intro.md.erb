* Read Chapter 2 and 3 in \[AWDR\]. I highly recommend you follow along with the coding examples and stick with it until you get it to work. I expect that you will not 'understand' much of what is going on, but try not to let that worry you. One of the objections that some people have about Rails is that there is too much 'magic'. By the end of the course you will understand what is happening and why, and the 'magic' will turn into 'convenience' and 'productivity'. A crucial thing to try and understand is what the MVC model is about. And the second essential concept is Object-Relational Mapping. Both MVC and ORM are not Rails nor Ruby concepts. They are foundational ideas which came before, and are used in many other architectural patterns. It is complicated and we will go over it many times during this course so expect to not follow everything. All of your coding should be in <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %> in a subdirectory called "AWDR". <%= deliverable_po "Answer the warmup questions in Latte" %>

#### Homework Discussion

* What is an ORM?
* What is MVC?
* Brainstorm: What are all the things that happen when I type http://www.salas.com into my web browser? Everyone talks!

* Why do they call Rails 'opinionated' software?
* Go through the directory structure?
* Key files and directories
	* Routes.rb
