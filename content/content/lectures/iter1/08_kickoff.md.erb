<%= homework_hdr %>
* Complete <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %> Look closely at the end of <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %> where two deliverables are specified. <%= deliverable "Upload your code to github; run it through Codeclimate; write a post with the requested information about your solution." %>
* Begin working on Programming Assignment 3, <%= link_to_topic :pa_mazes %>. This assignment is a little different, requiring you to get good with writing a more complicated algorithm than before. As usual, you will be doing your coding in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. Start a new top level directory for this second PA, i.e. `mazes`.
<%= include_topic :hw_paper_prototyping %>

#### Homework Review
* Discussion about Mazes assignment, how it works, answer any questions
* Discuss some of the concepts and ideas from the articles. Lets look at some design images

#### What each team will have by the end of the course
* Online:
	* Using some sharing technology among team members. Examples are google drive, slack, trello, or anything else. Mainly a shared folder. This will be used to collaborate on group documents with documents, designs, notes, etc. Everything but code!
	* A single github repo for the project, with all the code
	* Continuous integration testing and deployment using [CodeShip](https://codeship.com) and static analysis of code with [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com
   )
	* A cloud deployment of the application, running the app, using [Heroku]https://www.heroku.com)
* Individual artifacts such as:
	* Prioritized list of stories
	* Paper prototype/mockup of the key screens including ux flows.
	* Schema/Data Models
	* Code for product
   * Etc.
