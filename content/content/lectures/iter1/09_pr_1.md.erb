* Each team has to prepare for the meeting with the PRs.
* Meet as a team again and prepare a brief presentation:
  * Plan to talk for no more than 5 minutes per project. Less is ok too.
  * **make sure** one of you can describe the product concept clearly so the PRs understand it.
  * Show whatever you have already on the product's design, for example the list of features, sketches of the home page, idas about the architecture. Whatever you have.
  * Slides are not required (but are certainly ok if it helps you)
  * **make sure** Prepare a one page summary of the above information and print about 10 copies.
