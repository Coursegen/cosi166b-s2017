<%= homework_hdr %>
* **NoSql dabases:** There's a 'new' generation of databases which are non-relational often known as NOSQL databases. Here's one article about it: [NoSQL vs SQL](https://www.udemy.com/blog/nosql-vs-sql-2/). There are many many more. Do your own additional research and write your own view from that research about the advantages and disadvantages of NoSQL vs. 'traditional' SQL databases. Include a link to your source(s). <%= deliverable "Your report, 1 page or less. Pdf. Include name and assignment #" %>
* **Reading:** Read \[AWDR\]Chapter 5 and 6. In chapter 5 Notice how he introduces what I called <%= link_to_topic :ux_flows %>. He calls it a Page Flow, but it's the same exact idea. You need this because you won't be able to code the app without knowing what the flow is. It's fundamental! And also, notice how he discusses an initial guess at application data, which is the same as what you've been doing on your projects!. In Chapter 6, Notice that `rails new depot` creates a directory called "depot" whereever you are. So in cd to your portfolio directory before doing your that command. It is important that you actually follow along and do all the code in Chapter 6, prove to yourself that it runs. You will discover that to write a web app you need to use many different 'langauges': Ruby, Html, css, and other languages. Don't expect to understand everything, we will be going over this several more times. But try, really try. <%= deliverable "Do the warmup assignment for the reading." %>
* **Mazes:** Continue working Programming Assignment 3, <%= link_to_topic :pa_mazes %>. As usual, you will be doing your coding in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>, directory `mazes`.
* **Projects:** You should be working or completed steps **GIT, DOCUMENTATION, PLANSKEL, SHEMASKEL, BUILDSKEL, STORYSDV, PAPERSDV, SCHEMASDV**.
