1. **Read** [The F35s terible bug list](http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/02/f-35s-terrifying-bug-list/125638/?oref=DefenseOneTCO) to see the real world impact that bugs have. Also tht Fighter jets are really computers with wings on them!
1. **Read** [There's more to Ruby Debugging than puts](https://engineering.shopify.com/17489080-theres-more-to-ruby-debugging-than-puts?utm_medium=email&utm_source=rubyweekly). Lots of very practical tips and ideas about debugging, as well as some really useful Ruby tricks.
1. **Read** [Test Doubles in Theory, in Minitest and Rspec](http://ieftimov.com/test-doubles-theory-minitest-rspec). Test doubles, mocks, and similar concepts are a powerful abstraction for independently testing complex subsystems. Of course we're using minitest, but rspec is a popular alternative test framework. Bottom line they are both quite similar to each other.
