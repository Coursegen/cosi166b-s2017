##### Review: resources in Rails
* Automatic wiring of plumbing between urls, routing, models, and controllers
* Takes advantage of standardized patterns
    * Nesting model in the URLs
    * CRUD operations as actions
    * Path naming (path_to_user instead of "")
    * Controller naming
* Huge time saver and bug saver!

##### Controller Actions
* Who calls the controller action?
* What parameters are supplied automatically by the controller action?
* Sessions, why they are needed and how they work
* Why does it take two separate actions to implement "create"?

### Authentication and Authorization
<%= include_topic :intro_auth %>

#### Possible implementation strategies in Rails
* Roll your own, using simple authentication
* Look at other options: [Clearance](https://rubygems.org/gems/clearance) or [Sorcery]( https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery) or [Authlogic](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/binarylogic/authlogic)
* My advice: Avoid Devise. From my personal experience Devise is a tempation because it looks so magical but in the end it made life difficult. Many many people like Devise so this is my personal advice. YMMV.
