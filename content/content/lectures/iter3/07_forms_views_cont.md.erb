<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read: Chapter 20 and 21 of AWDR. Some of this will be familiar, some of this will be new and very useful for your projects. Make sure you understand the purpose of sessions and how they are implemented in general, and also specifically with Rails.
* Design the demo script for Showcase Day. The best demo scripts "hook" the viewer with an interesting, novel bit. They also tell a story, e.g. "Let's say I've not used by bicycle in 2 years and would like to get rid of it, and maybe exchange it for something else." Your demo script is a series of bulletted steps that are meant to be followed during the demo. Meet with your team and discuss what the demo script should be and choose one of you to write it.<%= team_deliverable "Demo Script, as pdf" %>
* **PA Rails 2**: Make your submission for <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>. <%= deliverable "Submit to Latte as per instructions on the assignment page." %>
