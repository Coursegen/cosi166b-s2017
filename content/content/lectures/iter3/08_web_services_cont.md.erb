1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Read and do**: Articles and do steps below:
  * [RESTful Web Services](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-restful/)
  * Download and install this [WebService Sample Play Code](https://github.com/pitosalas/webservicedemo) to your computer. Look at all the examples and get them to work. Understand what they are doing.
  * Download and install a REST Client app. For example [rest-client](https://code.google.com/p/rest-client/) or [Chrome Advanced Rest Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/)
  * Familiarize yourself with one or two real Web Services (also called Web APIs or APIs). Here are some interesting starting points:
    1. Everything known about wine: [Wine.com API](https://api.wine.com)
    1. Open Government Data: [Sunlight Foundation API](http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/)
    1. APIs of cooking recipes: [Yummly](https://developer.yummly.com)
    1. [Reddit API](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API)
    1. [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/developers/)
    1. [Weather Information](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)
    1. A huge directory of all kinds of web services: [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com)
  * Most web services (APIs) need an API-key of some kind (free). Get one
  * Experiment with the REST client and one of the Web services described above
  * Using the REST client app above: try some calls and get them to work
  * <%= deliverable "A post describing your experience. What api you tried and what you learned. And describing one specific way in which your product could use a Web Service API" %>
1. <%= zipbadge %> **Rails PA3**: Complete and submit <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_3 %>. <%= deliverable "PA 3 directory zipped up and submitted to Latte" %>
1. **Read**: About [Feature Toggles](http://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html), and about [WebSockets and ActionCables](http://www.sitepoint.com/action-cable-and-websockets-an-in-depth-tutorial/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email)
