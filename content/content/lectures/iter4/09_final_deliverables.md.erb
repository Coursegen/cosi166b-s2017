 Don't be scared by how much text is on this page. I am trying to be as detailed and specific as possible. I will answer all your questions about this and refine/revise this on the web site as we get closer to the Showcase.

* This is our equivalent of a final exam. Refer to the Grading info on the web site to see the impact.
* There are three deliverables: a demo, a presentation, and a portfolio page: <%= link_to_topic :cs_166_final_deliverables %>
* These are all team deliverables
* I expect that all of these will be in a 50-60% done state by Thursday
* See below for tips on each of these deliverables
* Everyone watch this video that gives fantastic tips on giving a good presentation: [This Week In Startups - Sharktank](http://thisweekinstartups.com/shark-tank-takeover-427/)

#### Details on final deliverables for the course
* Here are the details of what the deliverables should contain (by the showcase): <%= link_to_topic :cs_166_final_deliverables %>
